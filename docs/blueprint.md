# **App Name**: eRideWise

## Core Features:

- Predictive Maintenance - Anomaly Detection: Analyzes sensor data to detect anomalies indicative of component failures.
- Predictive Maintenance - Time-Series Regression: Estimates the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of critical EV components using time-series regression models.
- Dynamic Range Prediction: Provides real-time range estimates based on Battery SoC/SoH, GPS location, route topography, traffic, and ambient temperature.
- Rider Profile Analysis: Uses LSTM RNN (or similar) to analyze historical speed and acceleration/braking profiles to classify rider behavior (aggressive vs. economical) and use as a tool in the dynamic range and maintenance prediction.
- Contextual User Alerts: Delivers predictive data as actionable notifications via a mobile app or vehicle dashboard.
- Real-time Data Integration: Collects and processes real-time data from the vehicle's sensors, GPS, and external APIs.
- Dashboard Visualization: Presents predicted RUL, range estimates, and rider profiles via an intuitive user interface.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Electric blue (#7DF9FF) evoking technology and forward movement.
- Background color: Dark gray (#2A303C), providing contrast and a modern feel.
- Accent color: Bright lime green (#32CD32), highlighting critical information and calls to action.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif for a modern, neutral look.
- Use clean, minimalist icons representing various vehicle components and data points.
- Data-rich dashboards should be structured logically, with clear hierarchy and intuitive navigation.
- Use subtle animations to visualize data updates and predictive outcomes.
